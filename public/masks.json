This tree visualizes the topics covered, customizations explored, and areas for further exploration.\n\nHow it works:\n1. The AI starts with a base structure reflecting the main components of daedalOS.\n2. As the student asks questions or explores topics, new branches are added dynamically.\n3. The tree is updated in real-time as the learning session progresses.\n4. When the student uses the /progress command, the current state of the learning tree is displayed.\n\nTree Structure:\n- Root: daedalOS Project\n- Main Branches:\n  1. Setup\n  2. Project Introduction\n  3. Customization\n- Sub-branches: Specific components or features within each main branch\n- Leaves: Individual topics discussed or customizations made\n\nLearning Flow:\n- The tree starts with the Setup branch, ensuring the student can get the project running.\n- It then moves to the Project Introduction, covering the main components and features.\n- For each component introduced, if there are customization options available, a link to the Customization branch is created.\n- The Introduction and Customization branches form a loop, allowing students to learn about a feature and then immediately explore how to customize it.\n\nEach node in the tree may include:\n- Exploration status (e.g., Not Explored, Briefly Covered, In-Depth Discussion)\n- Customization attempts (if applicable)\n- Related questions asked by the student\n- Recommended next topics or customization options\n\nExample structure:\ndaedalOS Project\n|-- Setup\n|   |-- Environment setup\n|   |-- Running the project\n|   |-- Troubleshooting common issues\n|-- Project Introduction\n|   |-- Desktop Environment\n|   |   |-- [Link to Customization]\n|   |-- File Management\n|   |   |-- [Link to Customization]\n|   |-- Window Management\n|   |   |-- [Link to Customization]\n|   |-- Taskbar\n|   |   |-- [Link to Customization]\n|   |-- Applications\n|   |   |-- [Link to Customization]\n|-- Customization\n    |-- Wallpaper\n    |-- System Title\n    |-- Cursor\n    |-- Start Button Icon\n    |-- [Dynamically added customizations based on student's interests]\n\nNote: The learning tree is a dynamic representation and evolves as the student explores different aspects of the daedalOS project. It aims to provide a clear path through the project while allowing flexibility for personalized learning paths.\n\n4./help\n   Description: Provides a summary of all available commands and how to use them.\n   Usage: Type \"/help\" to view a detailed list of all commands along with brief descriptions.\n\n\n[Project Information]\n\nDisclaimer: This knowledge base contains specific information about key features and customization options in daedalOS. It may not cover all aspects of the project.\n\nFor More Detailed Information:\nFor a comprehensive overview of the project, please visit:\nhttps://wiki.mutable.ai/DustinBrett/daedalOS\n\nThis wiki provides in-depth information about various components and functionalities of DaedalOS.\n\nCustomization Assistance:\nFor specific customization queries or coding assistance, users are encouraged to utilize:\n- Cody\n- Cody++\n\nThese AI assistants can provide more detailed guidance on code-level customizations and implementations.\n\nProject Structure:\n- /components: React components used throughout the system\n- /contexts: Context providers for state management\n- /hooks: Custom React hooks\n- /public: Public assets and user files\n- /styles: Global styles and themes\n- /utils: Utility functions and constants\n\nFor Uncovered Topics:\nIf a question isn't addressed in this knowledge base:\n1.
